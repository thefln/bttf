  Isn’t there at least one lifeguard in the crowd?
  This kid’s in too deep, he’s about to drown
  In a pool of dark brown pricy poison

Hanging in there while they stop and stare

Isn’t there at least one lifeguard in the crowd?

This kid’s in too deep, he’s about to drown

In a pool of dark brown pricy poison

He’s exposed, naked, but he won’t beg your pardon

He can’t see shit, and he’s about to choke

Lost in a black cloud of white smoke

Still he makes you laugh with his jokes

And still buys you a drink when he’s broke

So won’t somebody save King Blue?

Where’s that lifeguard we mentioned in line two?

Somebody call for help, and make sure help’s a girl

The most beautiful thing in this big bad world

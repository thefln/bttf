  Temperature on that autumn day was at its most bittersweet
  Cool, soft breeze, no jacket needed
  But you knew it wouldn't last

Temperature on that autumn day was at its most bittersweet

Cool, soft breeze, no jacket needed

But you knew it wouldn't last

It was like sleeping with a girl knowing she'd break your heart soon enough

Nature, like nostalgia, is a cruel mistress

Gets you high and leaves you low

The dead trees whispered in my ear

"Your time will come too"

And I laughed, because I knew they were just waiting to go all Jesus on us
